## Credits
I used a dragon icon for the title image. However in order to make this possible I had to download it from Font Awesome, which is allowed according to thier liscense agreement as long as I add a credit on the deployed project. I did not make the dragon icon and it belongs to Font Awesome, as can be found  [here](https://fontawesome.com/icons/dragon?style=solid).
